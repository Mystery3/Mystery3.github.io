<h1>Project Nearing Completion</h1>
<h2>12/1/2023</h2>
<p>
    Over the past few months I've been overhauling the RotMG Sprite Renderer. Now, a majority of the UI elements will be object-oriented in addition to some new objects and functions for handling rendering and IO. This has made the code considerably easier to read (though I still have to add more comments) and easier to modify. In the future, I made add some small features like changing the default directory of sheets, renders, and textures, but I don't plan to do it on the initial release of the new version. Another feature I considered was a more integrated UI customizer (ie for colors and such) but color changing is currently possible in the config file, it is just a bit clunky as many colors are repeated and I haven't set up any references. This feature seems somewhat out of the scope for the project, especially considering that most people will likely use the dark theme regardless. Among the new features that I am including are: 
    <ul>
        <li>Scrollable renders in the main app</li>
        <li>A new texture picking window (with many more textures)</li>
        <li>An overhauled UI</li>
        <li>Outline colors</li>
        <li>Shadow colors</li>
        <li>Tooltips</li>
        <li>A customizable font size</li>
        <li>Padding options for previews</li>
        <li>A settings window</li>
        <li>Faster renders</li>
        <li>More I can't think of right now</li>
    </ul>
