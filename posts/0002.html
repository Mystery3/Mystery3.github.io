    I haven't got much to do today, so I'll talk a little about my favorite band (right now), Porcupine Tree! They're a prog rock/metal band from England who were mostly popular in the 1990s-2000s, though they recently came back together for 1 last album. Steven Wilson's (the band lead's) mentality on music production is admirable to me, as well as his outlook on popular music media. Porcupine Tree tends to produce what they want to produce, generally uninfluenced by their fans, by media, and by labels. This has led to some really unique and enjoyable music, including everything from their psychedelic era to their more recent ones. Their songs are full of emotions and often do try to say something to the audience. The sounds they make are different to every band I've heard before. <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nGeSnTVZWKqLovmid5gzL9i3VPMPUSPts">In Absentia</a> is a great first album to listen to from them. Some of my favorite albums from them are <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kt96NtKezy_p8WZ3zpC3yz3M3Grt7k1cc">Fear of a Blank Planet</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lo-Hag0qOOFGu0dkwDmf4a09Cu7derz6E">The Incident</a>, and <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kVfc9l91-Ool9Vzyr1AqiQZ15LMZeGFw4">Stupid Dream</a>, though I think every album of theirs is wonderful. Thanks for reading!
