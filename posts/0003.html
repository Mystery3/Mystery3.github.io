    Happy New Year to anyone reading this in January. Around the turn of the year I started bingewatching Doctor Who. I'd seen much of it before, but that was a time ago and I really forgot most of it. While a bit geeky, Doctor Who is quite lore-rich, probably because it's been running for so long. Some of the British humor in it is also rather silly at times. So far I'm partway through season 5, with Matt Smith as the doctor. I'd say that David Tennant was my favorite doctor though. It's also a nice break from anime, which had halted my watching of real-life shows for probably over a year. Anyway bye thanks for reading.
